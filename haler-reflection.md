__**Anthony Haler's Reflection**__
- What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
</br>`The difference between merging and committing is the main concept I wasn't 
fully grasping.`
- What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
</br>`Merging and committing were definitely clarified for me 
while completing this GPS.`
- What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
</br>`I asked the guide some questons about where to submmit the assigment and a few 
git command questions. I did ask the pair a few questions about markdown.`
- What still confuses you about Git?
</br>`I feel fairly confident with my knowledge of git but I do know 
that there is always more to learn and I will continue`
- How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
</br>` My first experince with GPS pairing was exciting and nerve wracking. 
I had a lot of fun meeting both my pair and the instructor and getting to 
interact with them! I was nervous though because like most people I believe you 
always want to make a good first impression and just overall do well.`
